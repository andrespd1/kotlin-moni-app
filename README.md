# Moni Kotlin App

## What is this? 
This is an Android mobile app that helps university students (that are specifically from the University of los Andes) find and schedule tutoring sessions on almost any topic,
academic or non-academic. Students will be able to search for tutors and access to their basic information regarding their qualifications, charges and background to teach certain
topic while tutors will be able to offer their services in a platform specifically made for it. Also, the app will allow for students to review and grade teachers for others to see 
and avoid or prefer certain tutors. Finally, students will be able to schedule a session easily, get session reminders and navigate through the app to find tutors and times for scheduling 
their session that meet their needs and expectations.
